# FlightRank-2025 Competition
- Build a recommendation system that predicts 
  which flight option  a business traveler is most 
  likely to choose within a given search session.
- The model has to rank all the available flight 
  options from best to worst based on the user’s 
  specific preferences, company policies and 
  other factors
 ### Motivation 
- Our goal is to create a model that predicts 
  future airline recommendation system’s 
  performance using a large and complex. 
  dataset from a global competition.
